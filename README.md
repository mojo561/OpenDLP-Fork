Note: there is a lot to do to get this to work... contact me if you wish to get this version of OpenDLP running. Otherwise, please refer to https://github.com/ezarko/opendlp for an actual working OpenDLP project without our additions
Most of the code under agent/src is not ours, our changes are minimal
